## Numeric Dice
d% is often used in place of a d100. It is described in some rules as a 'percentile die'

## Fate Dice

Instead of a normal N-sided dice, your game may use 'Fate'-style dice. These dice are generally 6 sided with the values ('-', '-', ' ', ' ', '+', '+'. (Equivalent to a three sided dice).
Internally these values are treated as -1, 0 and +1.

To use Fate dice, the syntax supports the following:
- **dF** - a single Fate die
- **1dF** - a single Fate die
- **2dF** - multiple Fate die

## Alternative Fate Dice

Some systems represent Fate dice as U instead of dF. dF is the most popular choice so we have chosen to stick with it.
Additionally you might find "dF.1", "dF.2" and "dF.3" elsewhere. These expand to:

- dF.3 - [+,+,+,-,-,-]
- dF.2 - [+,+,-,-,0,0] (This is the same as the usual 'dF')
- dF.1 - [+,0,-,0,0,0]

As the number indicates how many plus and minus symbols to have on the dice, any number larger than 3 is treated as dF.3

## Others

Occasionally just 'c' is used for a HEADS, TAILS flip of a dice. GNOLL also supports this syntax.

If there is a common shorthand you are aware of that is not implemented you can file an issue or you can define custom dice by [Creating Custom Macros](./custom_macros.html). Less common ones may be accepted as [Built-In Macros](./builtin_macros.html).
